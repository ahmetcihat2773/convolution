# Introduction

The convolution f \* g is a mathematical operation on two functions f and g. The function g is mirrored on and then then shifted (both on the x-axis) over the function f.
The result of f \* g  is the value of the area between the two overlapping functions f and g at each point when shifting g over f. The following image gives an intuitive idea 
about what the convolution is doing:
